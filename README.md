# User-centric design and analysis

## Analyst
I started as an analyst in consulting, where I built user-centric thinking while creating decks for senior leaders. However, due to confidentiality, I cannot share any of those documents. At Pratham, I doubled-down on this skill in 2 ways: one, by gaining expertise in more complex tooling to communicate insights through Tableau; and two, by presenting insights to diverse consumers: field officers, teachers, pedagogy experts and the CEO. Here are some samples of my work there:

1. [Program Health Monitor](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eshan8280/viz/RI2018-19Dashboard/RI): I built this dashboard for 3 types of consumers:
    * Content experts, so that they could explore poor performing geographies in Math and Language
    * Local administrators, so that they could monitor attendance trends and plan visits 
    * National and local leaders, so that they could track progress on overall Math and Language goals

**Extra context**: To gauge the complexity of problem Pratham was trying to solve, you can look at this simple [page](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eshan8280/viz/LearningCampDashboard_Y-2_HG/Story1), where I highlight national and local variations in children's learning. 

2. [Where to focus](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eshan8280/viz/VillageStatusTracker-ForTrackingPlanning/MS) I created this dashboard to help local leaders make quarterly plans along two dimensions, one, FLN (foundational literacy and numeracy) skills of children, and two, availability of local help (volunteers). 

3. [How to communicate](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eshan8280/viz/VRC-OnePager_v3/Dashboard1): This dashboard was created to help our local field officers communicate results of a household-level survey, as a part of which, we tested children on FLN skills. This was part of a broader initiative called [_Our Village_](https://www.pratham.org/about/hamara-gaon/)

## Design (Non-confidential)
As a part of a graduate level course in UX Design, I worked on multiple projects. More details below:
